            The protocol records eligible winners and their winning stakes in the reward vault. The
            protocol treasury divides the market's available ETH equally across every enabled stock,
            swaps into those tokens, and transfers them to the vault. Each winner's claim is
            calculated separately for each acquired token. If a stock purchase fails, the protocol
            operator can retry it before the reward vault is finalized.
